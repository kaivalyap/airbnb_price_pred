Project objective:
Airbnb is a multinational company which provides a platform for houses, villas, flat owners and hotels to put
their properties on rent for tenants/tourists etc. The owners have to determine a rate/price for there properties.
The data used for this project includes fields such as property type, room type, no. of bedrooms, bathrooms and 
accomodates and also some information about the host such as date since hosting started, host response rate, is 
host id verified etc. This project will create a model which will predict the price of the property based on a wide
range of features to avoid overpricing or underpricing of the property by the owners. 

Work done till 24/11/2021:

	- Finalized project group of 2 members
	- Finalized project idea, dataset
	- Git repository created and updated

	- Datasets considered till now:
	  : Emotion recognition from facial expressions 
	  : Income prediction using census data
	  : Prediction of confirmation probability of Railway waiting list ticket
	  : Music reccomendation system using spotify dataset

	- Dataset finalized for project:
	  : Airbnb data analysis and price prediction in 6 USA cities

	- Resources used for searching project ideas and datasets:
	  : kaggle.com
	  : datasetsearch.research.google.com

25,26,27/11/2021:

	- Project flow design done
	- Research and study on the internet to understand different ways of data cleaning
	- Data cleaning process started

28/11/2021:
	- Filled missing data from the dataset including the columns ['bathrooms', 'bedrooms', 'beds']
	- Transformed textual data to numerical
	- Primary cleansing completed
	- Cleaning date columns
	- Remaining tasks: Handling the amenities column, cleaning host_response_rate, review_score_rating

29/11/2021:
	- Cleaned remaining columns : host_response_rate, review_score_rating
	- Remaining tasks in data cleaning : Handling the amenities column

16/12/2021:
	- For handling the amenities column, which contained a set of amenities for each property, refered many examples on kaggle. Found some ways to convert it into useful data.
	  Finally, converted the amenities column to numeric by calculating the number of amenities in a row.

27/12/2021:
	- The original file required some more cleaning (the columns host_has_profilepic and host_identity verified had 3 unique values but they should contain only 2 - 't' and 'f' 
	  This was because they were encoded before filling missing values)
	- Created new notebook for generating new cleaned csv file which is ready for visualizations.
	  Seperate cleaning of the data was needed to generate csv file. This file should contain textual data instead of numerical.

28/12/2021:
	- Some additional cleaning for better visualization in PowerBI
	- new .csv file generated for visualization
	- Created price column from log price
	- Tried some visualizations on maps in powerBI

17/1/2022:
	- model building started
	- built a simple linear regression model for testing
	- tried different algorithms and checked their efficiency

30/1/2022:
	- tried exporting pickle file
	- created basic html webpage interface for checking functionality

5/02/2022:
	- improved the webpage design 
	- checked different algorithms like decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, xgboost, knn, svm
	- selected random forest as its mae, mse were less
	
13/02/2022:
	- fine tuning of randomforest model using its hyperparameters
	- more cleaning to improve accuracy of the model
	- created pickle file
	- improved the webpage design using css
	- updated user interface according to new changes

15/02/2022:
	- final changes done
